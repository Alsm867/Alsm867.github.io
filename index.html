        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate about learning something new. I took the 24 week
          course at App Academy, where I learned various coding languages and
          skills, and I utilized what I learned to create fully functional
          websites. I'm a team player, and take charge when it's needed. The
          unknown is does not intimidate me. In fact I love the challenge and
          welcome it.

        <h3>Stellar Note Nov 2021</h3>
        <img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dzjkwepju/image/upload/v1638485990/Styckr/Screenshot_2021-12-02_170921_ydzeli.png' alt='stellar' width='800px' height='500px' />

        <p>
          This is my clone of Evernote with Express, React, and redux with a
          retro 80’s space theme. To match the notes with the notebook it
          belongs to I used associations in the backend database to make sure
          the note stays with it’s related notebook. I used a CKEditor api to
          add a text editor to the notes so the user can style their notes more
          than just the plain text. To implement a seamless user experience I
          created an auto save function with a setTimeout to save the state
          every 4.5 seconds so the user doesn’t have to worry about manually
          saving their notes.

        <h3>Angry Cloud Nov 2021</h3>

        <p>
          My group and I cloned SoundCloud using Python, React.js, Flask, and a
          theme of angry music. To render an api that persists throughout the
          app to play song files, We had to create a context in the state to
          constantly add, and take away songs from the player itself based on
          which song/playlist you chose to listen to. Using AWS we created a
          file upload system so users can create their own songs and playlists
          with their unique album art. We had to build a full route and multiple
          flask files and a full api route to react / redux to render the newly
          made songs. To Create a seamless experience when creating, editing, or
          deleting a comment we used Redux state to automatically listen for
          those changes to dynamically render them.

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>Herman Miller</h3>
        <p>
          I started as an assembly line worker where I learned all the positions
          they had in the assembly line as well as the machine operating part of
          the Casegoods department. I learned the entire process that goes into
          building the furniture from machining all the parts and putting it all
          together as well as all the components that went into them(drawers,
          doors, handles, drawer slides, etc.). I made it my mission to learn
          everything, and I accomplished that mission by the time I left that
          company. I moved up to a position called Responder where I was put in
          charge of 5 assembly lines. I was tasked with making sure the lines
          were running smoothly, fixing any machine or tool that went down(if I
          couldn’t fix it within 3 mins I would call maintenance to fix it so I
          can get production moving as quickly as possible). I would write any
          struggles that a line would have had every hour on what we called an
          hour by hour chart, so that my higher ups will know what slowed down
          production or why we didn’t meet that hour's goal. I was also in
          charge of who worked on what line for that day to utilize everyone’s
          skills in the right spots on the line for better production.
        </p>
        <h3>Temp Worker</h3>
        <p>
          I was a temp worker for Herman Miller through the Adecco agency where
          I worked at two different departments. One department was to refill
          the fabric needed for three different lines. I was in charge of
          pulling manifests that told me what fabric was needed and for what
          line, and I had to locate the fabric and bring it to the line before
          they ran out of work. The second department I was pulling manifests
          that told me what boxes were needed for what department. I would
          locate the boxes in bulk and place them on carts and bring them to the
          department that needed them. the boxes in bulk and place them on carts
          and bring them to the department that needed them.
